* new vapor project
```shell
vapor new [ProjectName]
cd [ProjectName]/
vapor build
vapor run
```
* this might take some time since it downloads a bunch of dependancies
```shell
terminal message : server starting on http://localhost:8080
```
* go to a webrowser and go http://localhost:8080 to check if vapor is ready to use

* there are some files created
* but not an xcode project yet. Create one.
*Yet, do not forget to close the server(http://localhost:8080)down with ctrl + c 
```shell
vapor xcode -y
```
* open router.swift on xcode

* set the running scheme
  * Run â†’ My Mac



* Fluent?
* Leaf?
